    Leo Percovich (born 20 April 1968) is a Uruguayan former professional goalkeeper and coach who was a long-serving member of Middlesbrough’s backroom staff.
    Percovich joined Middlesbrough's coaching staff in 2013 as a goalkeeping coach and remained until the appointment of <a href="/people/managers/garry_monk.html" target="_self">Garry Monk</a>.
    He would later return to the club in 2019 as part of <a href="/people/managers/jonathan_woodgate.html" target="_self">Jonathan Woodgate</a>'s backroom team.
    <br><br>
    Percovich was appointed Middlesbrough’s caretaker manager on the 3rd October 2022 following the departure of <a href="/people/managers/chris_wilder.html" target="_self">Chris Wilder</a>.
    During his caretaker spell he managed the side for a short series of five Championship fixtures, including a 1-0 victory over Birmingham City, and worked with his coaching team of Lee Cattermole, Mark Tinkler and Craig Liddle to maintain stability.
    His interim spell ended after just 3 weeks on the 24th, after which <a href="/people/managers/michael_carrick.html" target="_self">Michael Carrick</a> was appointed as head coach.
