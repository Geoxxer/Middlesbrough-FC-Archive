<p class="center">
    Rob Edwards was appointed manager of Middlesbrough FC on 24 June 2025, following a stint with Luton Town FC where he achieved promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs in the 2022-23 season.
    Edwards signed a three-year contract with Middlesbrough, replacing former manager Michael Carrick who missed out on the play-off final against Luton that same year.
