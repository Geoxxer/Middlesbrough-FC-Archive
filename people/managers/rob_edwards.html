<p class="center">
    Rob Edwards was appointed manager of Middlesbrough FC on 24 June 2025, following a stint with Luton Town FC where he achieved promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs in the 2022-23 season.
    Edwards signed a three-year contract with Middlesbrough, replacing former manager <a href="/people/managers/michael_carrick.html" target="_self">Michael Carrick</a> who missed out on the play-off final against Luton that same year.

    Edwards' Tenure
</h2>
<p class="center">
    Rob Edwards took over Middlesbrough FC ahead of the 2025-26 season with low expectations following his shambolic season with Luton Town. 
    Despite this, Rob Edwards managed to turn things around quickly at Middlesbrough.
    The season started strongly for Middlesbrough, with them having 21 points and sitting in 2nd.
    Edwards' Middlesbrough boasted the club's best start to a season since Bryan Robson's first season in charge back in 1994-95, who would go on to lead Middlesbrough to promotion as champions that season.
    Things were looking good for Middlesbrough; that is, until Wolves (who were at the bottom of the Premier League) sacked their manager, Vítor Pereira on the 2nd November 2025 and immediately set their sights on Edwards as a candidate for the job.
    Middlesbrough refused to let Edwards go however, stating that they had no intention of letting their manager leave so soon after joining the club but Edwards had his head turned.
    And while Rob played down the links to Wolves, it was evident that he was considering the move.
    On the 8th November 2025, it was announced that Rob Edwards would not be taking part in the match against Birmingham City that same day and that Assistant Head Coach Adi Viveash would instead be in the dugout as the main man.
    It was clear that Edwards was no longer welcome at the club, as fans were chanting abuse against him and banners were held up by the Red Faction supporters group.
    One banner read, 'THE FANS "DESERVE TO SEE PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO BE HERE"' which was a direct quote from Edwards while at Middlesbrough.
    Another read, 'ROB EDWARDS YOU RAT!'
    The last banner said, 'UNITY IS OUR STRENGTH - WE MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER' which was a message of solidarity from the fans to the rest of the squad and coaching staff.
    A banner, that was requested to be displayed by Edwards throughout the season, usually said 'Stronger Together' but it was spray-painted over to say 'Stronger WITHOUT ROB'
    Confirmation of Edwards' departure was confirmed on the 12th November 2025 at 14:00.
    Harry Watling left Middlesbrough alongside Edwards, and so Adi Viveash was appointed interim manager.
    His replacement was Kim Hellberg who came from Hammarby IF in Sweden and joined on the 24th November 2025.
