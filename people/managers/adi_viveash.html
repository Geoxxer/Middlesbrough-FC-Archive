<p class="center">
    Adi Viveash (born 30 September 1969) joined Middlesbrough's backroom staff in the summer of 2025 brought in by Middlesbrough along side <a href="/people/managers/rob_edwards.html" target="_self">Rob Edwards</a>.
    He had a long playing career with clubs including Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading and later worked extensively in youth development (notably at Chelsea) before moving into senior coaching roles.
    Viveash stepped up as Middlesbrough’s interim manager after Edwards was stood down from first-team duties in November 2025.
    He took charge of the team for a short interim spell while the club searched for a permanent replacement.
    Adi's caretaking period covered three fixtures and concluded when the club appointed <a href="/people/managers/kim_hellberg.html" target="_self">Kim Hellberg</a> as head coach later in November; Viveash then resumed his role within the coaching team.
    He described the stint as brief and emotionally testing, and expressed disappointment with how the interim spell ended after the final match
