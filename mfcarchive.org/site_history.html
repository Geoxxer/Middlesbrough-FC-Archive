    MFCarchive.org was originally created in October 2024 as a personal project to collect the full match recordings of Middlesbrough's fixtures.
    While not the main point of the website now, the Full90 section remains a core part of the site and is still being updated with the ocasional addition of new full match videos.
    Currently, the Full90 section contains full match videos from the 1995-96 season up to the 2024-25 season, with plans to add more seasons in the future.
    The UI for that part of the website is also being worked on to make it more user-friendly as it hasn't been updated to match the new style of the website yet.
</p>

<p class="center">
    On October 23rd, the website went through a major redesign to improve the user experience and make it easier to navigate.
    While the Full90 section remains a core part of the website, the redesign also introduced new sections such as People, History, and Articles to provide a more comprehensive archive of Middlesbrough FC's history.
    The introduction of a home-screen which was also mobile friendly was a key part of the redesign, as it allows users to easily access different sections of the website from a single page.
    I also created new graphics and logos for the website so it would look much more aesthetically pleasing but made sure to keep the vintage feel of the website.
</p>

<p class="center">
    I want to quickly touch on the future of the website.
    As of the 29th October 2025, I still plan to continue adding more content to the website, including more full match videos, historical articles, and player profiles.
    But I would also like to state that I am the sole creator and maintainer of this website, and while I am passionate about Middlesbrough FC and its history, I do have other commitments in my life such as work and studies.
    While updates may not be as frequent as I would like them to be, this is a passion project for me. A labour of love if you will.

    For those wondering, the website is hosted on GitHub and you can find the link to the website files <a href="https://github.com/Geoxxer/Middlesbrough-FC-Archive">here</a>.
    The website is purely built on just HTML and CSS and contains no JavaScript or backend code.
    That could change in the future but for now, I only know how to code in aforementioned languages (and quite primatively at that).
    Github also allows you to download the website files and you can select a specific time/branch to download if you wish to see how the website has evolved over time.
