    Hi there!
    My name is Alex, and I am the creator of MFCarchive.org.
    I am a lifelong Middlesbrough FC fan, and I created this website to help preserve the history of the club by archiving anything about the club that has significance.
    As a passionate supporter, I believe that every match holds significance in the club's journey, and it's essential to keep these moments accessible for future generations of fans.
    While I cannot help the performances on the pitch, I can ensure that the history of Middlesbrough FC is preserved for future fans to enjoy.

    A bit more indepth about me:
    I have been  a Boro fan since I was born but never felt like I had contributed enough to my club, so I decided to make this website as a way to give back to the club I love.
    While I am not currently a season ticket holder, I have been in the past and I still attend matches often and follow the team closely home & away.
    I am quite young so my first game was in 2016. It was a nil-nil draw against Real Sociedad in a pre-season friendly and I still have the ticket for it.
    I was born in Middlesbrough and still reside in Teesside now.

    Originally, I created this website in order to archive full 90 videos of Middlesbrough FC matches, but I have since expanded the website to include other content such as historical articles, player profiles, and memorable moments in the club's history.
    Why did I expand it? Well I had an epiphany one day while looking at some old Middlesbrough FC photos to which I realised that I knew very little about the club's history despite being a fan for most my life.
    I wanted to make sure that fans like me could learn more about the club's rich history and appreciate the journey that Middlesbrough FC has been on over the years.

    There are a few people I have to thank for more than just help.
    Firstly, I'd like to thank my parents for getting me into football in the first place.
    When i was younger, I was much more into playing football rather than watching it.
    I used to be a part of an Under-12s team and really enjoyed being on it but couldn't understand the fun in watching football.
    Eventually, after alot of persistence from my dad, I started watching football alot more and while I always supported Boro, I started to follow the team more closely.
    Secondly, I'd like to thank Nige Moore. He made the website <a href="http://ayresomepark.co.uk" target="_blank">ayresomepark.co.uk</a> which was a massive inspiration for me to create my own website.
    I often found myself using his website as a guide to my own website and I owe alot of the structure and layout of my website to his.
    The website sadly hasn't been updated in a while (since 2018 I believe) and some of the link's are broken and the websites design is quite dated now.
    His website however, is a treasure trove of information about Middlesbrough FC, especially during the Ayresome Park era, and I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.
    I would also like to thank my mates (including the geordie who helped me enjoy football) who have supported the club along side me and helped create memories that will live forever in my heart.
    Finally, I would like to thank those who support the club day in and day out, no matter if the skies really are grey.
    Without the suppporters, I don't think I would have the same passion for the club that I do now.
