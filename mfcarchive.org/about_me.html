    Hi there!
    My name is Alex, and I am the creator of MFCarchive.org.
    I am a lifelong Middlesbrough FC fan, and I created this website to help preserve the history of the club by archiving anything about the club that has significance.
    As a passionate supporter, I believe that every match holds significance in the club's journey, and it's essential to keep these moments accessible for future generations of fans.
    While I cannot help the performances on the pitch, I can ensure that the history of Middlesbrough FC is preserved for future fans to enjoy.

    A bit more indepth about me:
    I have been  a Boro fan since I was born but never felt like I had contributed enough to my club, so I decided to make this website as a way to give back to the club I love.
    While I am not currently a season ticket holder, I have been in the past and I still attend matches often and follow the team closely home & away.
    I am quite young so my first game was in 2016. It was a nil-nil draw against Real Sociedad in a pre-season friendly and I still have the ticket for it.
    I was born in Middlesbrough and still reside in Teesside now.

    Originally, I created this website in order to archive full 90 videos of Middlesbrough FC matches, but I have since expanded the website to include other content such as historical articles, player profiles, and memorable moments in the club's history.
    Why did I expand it? Well I had an epiphany one day while looking at some old Middlesbrough FC photos to which I realised that I knew very little about the club's history despite being a fan for most my life.
    I wanted to make sure that fans like me could learn more about the club's rich history and appreciate the journey that Middlesbrough FC has been on over the years.
