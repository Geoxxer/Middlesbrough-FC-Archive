    Steve Gibson held an emergency press conference to dispute claims that Bryan Robson had held a crisis meeting with Steve Gibson and the club's directors.
    The rumours of a crisis meeting were sparked by an article in the The Mirror that made the claims.
    A recreation of that article can be seen below but you can find the original <a href="/the_club/events/images/mirror_article_11_01_97.jpg">here</a>.

    The article makes several links to Newcastle's Kevin Keegan, who had recently left his role as manager, and makes a suggestion that Steve Gibson was confident that Bryan Robson was the man for the job due to the funds provided for buying players.
    There is also a supposed quote from Steve Gibson however there is no evidence that this quote was ever made.
</p>

<p class="center">
    Later that day, Steve Gibson held a press conference to dispel the rumours, of which the video can be seen below.

    Steve Gibson said that 'Unfounded stories constantly appearing in the press which are causing this football club, minor problems.
    We would rather they didn't exist.'
    He then stated 'The club reserve the right (at this time) to seek legal advice and what action it will take against the Mirror and against the Mail.
    We would ask that both of their... both of them publications would consider retracting the story.
    It is untrue and unfounded.
    It slanders the name of Bryan Robson and the good name of Middlesbrough Football Club.
    That is all, thank you.'
</p>

<p class="center">
    The Mirror did not make any public apoligies however did clear up the situation in their next publication on the Monday after (13/01/1997).
    They wrote the article quite critcal of both Middlesbrough FC and Bryan Robson in particular.
    The article was written in almost a mocking tone.

    Included was a 'MOVE OF THE MATCH' which was 'The home fans' shift towards the Riverside Stadium exits long before the final whistle.' and a 'MOAN OF THE MATCH' which was a direct dig at Robson for his so-called 'verbal attack' on the Worcester official.
